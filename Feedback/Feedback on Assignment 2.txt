Q1 the code is correct however it prints out the larger number first.
Q2 the code is correct however it says thank you when you put a number over 20 instead of under.
These issues could be corrected by checking you output is giving what the question asked.

-----------------------------------
Well done on Q3 Q7 Q8

-----------------------------------
Q4 user_color == ('red', 'RED', 'Red', 'der') checks if the whole value of user_color is exactly equal to the all the values, 
not if it matches any one of the colors. You need to check each option separately using or e.g. 
if user_color == 'red' or user_color == 'RED' or user_color == 'Red':

-----------------------------------
Q5 the question wants the programme to ask the user if its raining first and then based on that answer is ask is it windy.
This means the windy input and if statement should be inside the rain if statement.

-----------------------------------
Q6 Converting the input to and int doesnt need to be done e.g. if user_age = '17'. Also since you converted it the 
if user_age = int(username) will always be true because it is converted.
Users that age are over 18 are told to go trick or treating it should be if user_age >= 18 they can vote.
You are missing the if user_age = 16 then they can buy scratch tickets. Again check your code is doing everything that 
is asked.

-----------------------------------
Q9 the code does not seperate out the different rates i.e first rate * 5%, second 10%.... 
also if you are multipling by the number percent and not as a decimal make sure you divide the answer by 100. e.g.

bill = 100
bill * 5 = 500
(bill * 5)/100 = 5
