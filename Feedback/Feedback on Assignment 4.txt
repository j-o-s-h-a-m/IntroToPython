Well done on Q1 Q6 Q8

------------------------
Q2 it is supposed to print the even numbers up to a given userber.

------------------------
Q3 and Q4 you used range(1, user), your code adds up all the numbers up to but not 
including the last number entered. Remember that in Python, the range() function stops before the second value. 
To include the final number, you should use range(1, user+1). Also on Q9 it doesnt multiply by the last number in the 
factoral e.g. if i input 3 it will just do 1*2 when it should do 1*2*3

------------------------
Q5 the table only goes up to num * 10 you need the range to be up to 13 to account for the it not including the number you 
enter. Also you should print out what is being multipled i.e. print(i,'x',user,'=',total)

------------------------
Q7 not uploaded on github please upload asap.

------------------------
General note: if you put the print statement outside of the for loop it will print the result after instead of everytime it 
goes through the loop.
